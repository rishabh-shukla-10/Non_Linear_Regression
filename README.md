# Non_linear_Regression

About the Dataset
 I am  going to try and fit a non-linear model to the datapoints corrensponding to China's GDP from 1960 to 2014. We download a dataset with two columns, the first, a year between 1960 and 2014, the second, China's corresponding annual gross domestic income in US dollars for that year.
